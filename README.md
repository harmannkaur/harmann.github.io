<h3> #10 Mcdonalds </h3>
<h6> Mcdonalds, a classic American fast food chain, is ranked number 10 out of 10 on my list of things that make me happy. I always purchase the 10 piece chicken nuggest meal with a Mocha Frappe. I really enjoy the meal, but would not have it often. It can cause me to feel quite gross at times. I also struggle to finish the entire meal, and find the fries too dry for my liking. However, if given an option to get a quick comfort food, I always doordash Mcdonald's, especially at debate tournaments. </h6>

<h3> #9 Coca Cola </h3> 
<h6> Coke Cola is the best carbonated beverage there is, especially when it is drank on a very hot day with ice. I personally like the canned version above all others. If it does have the fizz, it tastes horrible. Sometimes I drink more coke than I do water, and I understand that is concerning for my health, but I only do this when we're at the beach.  </h6>
<h3> #8 Rain </h3> 
<h6> I prefer the rain as the top two weather options of all time. Rain means that it is cold, something I really prefer. I also really like the cloudy and the lack of sunlight, since its something we don't get often in California.  </h6>
<h3> #7 Candles </h3> 
<h6> Candles are actually one of the most amazing inventions of all time. They can make the room smell good and light it up. I love going to stores and smelling candles and then buying them. However, due to some very close calls, I am not allowed to have candles in my room because I might catch my room on fire. My favorite candle smells like Christmas cookies.  </h6>
<h3> #6 Trader Joes </h3> 
<h6> Going to Trader Joes is actually the best event ever. You can get anything at Trader Joes and since its from Trader Joes, its automatically healthy. They have so many options and each one tastes so good. I love anything and everything from there. </h6>
<h3> #5 Chipotle </h3> 
<h6> Chipotle has been my favorite place to get food since the age of 8 years old, and I still have the same order. I hate beans, so I never get them in my bowl. My bowl has to come with a side of guac and a tortilla. It makes me super, duper full so I can't even eat anything else the same day I have Chipotle. I can have it anytime and it doesn't make me feel gross, compared to Mcdonald's because it seems so healthy.  </h6>
<h3> #5 My Room </h3> 
<h6> I spend most of my time in my room, so its filled with things I love. Overtime, I've just filled it up. I love my bed and I have a bunch of things on my wall. My rooms always messy, though, because I hate cleaning it. My favorite thing in my room is probably this giant painting of a bunch of birds with a gold frame around it.  </h6>
<h3> #4 My Little Pony </h3> 
<h6> I began watching My Little Pony when I was four years old. I have watched every episode, every season, every movie, and every spin off. Sometimes I still watch it. I think it was just such a pivotal point of my childhood. My favorite characters are Rainbowdash and Rarity.  </h6>
<h3> #3 Cousins </h3> 
<h6> My cousins came over this summer and spent a whole month at my house, and it was the funnest thing ever. They're really, really fun. My oldest cousin and I watched the NBA playoffs, my younger cousin had me do her makeup, and I got beat by my youngest cousin in chess. I miss them a lot. They're probably the only parts of my extended family i really like.  </h6>
<h3> #2 Friends </h3> 
<h6> Not all friends, just a selected few are top three. These are probably the friends I talk to on a day to day basis. This one is pretty self explanatory.  </h6>
<h3> #1 Family </h3> 
<h6> I love my parents and my brothers  </h6>
