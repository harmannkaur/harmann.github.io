<h3> #10 Mcdonalds </h3>
<h6> Mcdonalds, a classic American fast food chain, is ranked number 10 out of 10 on my list of things that make me happy. I always purchase the 10 piece chicken nuggest meal with a Mocha Frappe. I really enjoy the meal, but would not have it often. It can cause me to feel quite gross at times. I also struggle to finish the entire meal, and find the fries too dry for my liking. However, if given an option to get a quick comfort food, I always doordash Mcdonald's, especially at debate tournaments. </h6>
<h3> #9 Coca Cola </h3>
